# PHASE 1: FLATIRON X MORINGA SCHOOL INDEPENDET PROJECT
# JALI JAMII INITIATIVE
#### This application, individually selected as an assessment tool for the phase I content, aims to, inline with the SDG goal II, help eradicate hunger in the needy community by leveraging use of tech in a benevolent society to enable provision for and access to food by all, thus eradicationg hunger in the community it is used.

## Project Idea
One of UN’s sustainable development agenda is to eradicate hunger and end poverty by the year 2030.

Statics show that about 8.9% or 690 million people globally starve due to lack of resources to afford food.

It is also imperative to note that the world population is gradually increasing , and is expected to grow upto 8.7 billion in 2030. This has led to an increased pressure on the already minimal food production resource such as fertile land and  conducive aglicultural environment. This thus spells out a looming doo if the situation is not remedid by learning to utilize what is produced and do so efficiently.

It is worth noting the robust importance tech hold in solving our daily lives problems, and thus the inception of this project, where I aim to employ tech to solve a starvation crisis. 

A lot of food produced goes to waste due to short shelf life, poor preservation methods, poor storage infrastructure, e.t.c.
Food from grocery stores & supermarkets, restaurants and households, majorly end up in bins, despite rampant starvation.

With light of this, this project will thus give a:

>[SOLUTION](...)
by preventing food wastage, and translatively ensuring that such food is made accessible to those in need.
Herein, thus, is web app, where food vendors and donors, can interact with local beneficiaries for a seamless give where appreciated transaction with ultimate benevolence.

## Understanding The Interface
 
The web page will provide a section for donors to log in, post surplus safe food and the location, which shall be available to another cader of users, who are the beneficiaries, that may scroll through and be sufficed with thte sufficient info to access the food they desire.

## Program Setup Instruction
This application can be accessed in a variety of ways;
1. By running the [live link]() here or in the solution keyword.
1. If you feel a bit enthusiastic, feel welcome and go ahead to;
    * [Clone/fork this repo](https://github.com/TheEmerald001/Jali-Jamii-initiative.git)
    * Access it on your local and set up a firebase account and server.
    * Fireup the server and open the code in vs code.
    * play with the code as you may deem fit, allowing flexibility and new objects.

## Technologies Used
* This app revolves around algorithmic problem solving by applying logic, control flows, data structure, arithmetic expressions and logical analysis to accept, manipulate and return data. This is written in Javascript.
* Backend data storage and authentication is done using firebase, and thus its conumption as an enthusiat reequires a good understanding of firebase.
* A few gimmicks, oofcourse and more to come!
